Currently getting information about california fire smoke concentrations from 2017-present... <br>
After consulting members of the WFRT, I am likely to choose 2019 as my first year of analysis. <br>

I need to determine the exact type of weather event that makes the ship tracks more obvious. (The kind of event that took place off of the coast of California on April 24-25 2019) <br>

Kalman filter used becuase ship tracks have different velocity than surrounding clouds? <br>

New event now being studied. (Sept 12 14:00 to Sept 13 03:00)
